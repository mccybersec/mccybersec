mccybersec blog is an initiative by [Mario Cuomo](https://github.com/mariocuomo/) - Cloud Solution Architect Security at Microsoft.

This blog will cover topics related to Extended Detection and Response (XDR) and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) in the Microsoft ecosystem by leveraging technologies such as Defender XDR (Defender for Endpoint, Defender for Cloud (and Apps), Defender for Identity and Defender for Office 365), Sentinel and Security Copilot.

The goal is to share how Microsoftâ€™s suite of security products can work harmoniously and show the benefits of this holistic approach with tech blog posts.<br>
The idea is to publish a blog post every week, on Sunday.
